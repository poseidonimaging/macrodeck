= RESTful URIs

We've been using unRESTful URIs and it sort of sucks, so I'm going to redo it.

== /countries resource

Members:
   supported countries by code (us, uk, mx, etc.)
No member specified:
   lists all countries supported (currently us)

== /countries/<code>/states and /countries/<code>/provinces resource

Members:
   supported states or provinces by code
No member specified:
   shows a map to pick from

== /countries/<code>/states/<state>/cities and province equivalent resource

Members:
   cities by url_part
No member specified:
   shows a map or something, currently just a list.

== /countries/<code>/states/<state>/cities/<city>/places resource

Members:
   places, duh?
No member specified:
   shows all of the places

== Shorter links

The following shorter links will exist:
/city/<uuid-or-blessed-urlpart>: same as .../cities/xxx/
/place/<uuid>: same as .../cities/xxx/places/xxx/

Of course I'm currently looking into how to implement that RESTfully.

(Looks like I can use :shallow => true)
